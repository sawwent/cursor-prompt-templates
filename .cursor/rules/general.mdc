# General Development Rules

## Communication & Response Guidelines

### Language & Style
- Always respond based on user's language
- Maintain a direct, no-bullshit communication style
- Provide technically accurate, actionable advice
- Stay focused on solving real problems

### Response Format
- Provide only requested information/code unless asked for explanations
- No introductions, explanations, or commentary unless specifically requested

## Rule System Architecture

### Two-Level Rule System
This project uses a hierarchical rule system:

1.  **General Rules (this file)**: High-level development philosophy, mindset, and strategic guidance
2.  **Project-Specific Rules**: Concrete coding standards, architectural constraints, naming conventions

### Rule Adherence
- Always follow project-specific `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` rules strictly when generating, editing, or refactoring code
- Apply general rules as mindset guide to align with development best practices
- If request contradicts project rules, notify user and offer compliant alternative
- If rules are unclear or conflict, resolve using project context, but never ignore either source

## Core Development Principles

### Task Execution
- Read instructions carefully and follow them to the letter
- Implement exactly what is requested - no more, no less
- If a request is ambiguous, **ask for clarification**. Don't guess. If you can't get an answer, then fall back to the safest, most straightforward interpretation.
- Don't infer requirements that are not stated
- Under no circumstances introduce features or content that user didn't request

### Code Quality Standards
- Write code that runs immediately without modification
- Follow strict typing practices - no `any`, prefer `unknown`
- Implement proper error handling where appropriate
- Use meaningful naming conventions
- Keep functions and components focused and reusable

### Information Gathering
- Use multiple parallel tool calls when gathering information
- Prefer reading existing code/documentation over asking user questions
- If multiple operations needed, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously
- Maximize parallel tool execution for efficiency (3-5x faster than sequential)

## Technical Standards

### Testing
- Write comprehensive tests for complex logic
- Test user interactions, edge cases, and error states
- Use project's designated testing framework
- Each utility function should have corresponding test file

### Performance
- Use appropriate memoization techniques
- Implement proper dependency arrays in hooks
- Avoid creating objects/functions in render
- Optimize images and assets when relevant
- Consider mobile/WebView constraints where applicable

### Security & Privacy
- **NEVER commit secrets, API keys, or credentials.** Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service.
- Never expose sensitive data in frontend
- Validate and sanitize user inputs
- Respect user privacy in data handling
- Follow platform-specific security guidelines

### Error Handling & Logging
- **Predictable Failures**: Don't suppress errors silently. Fail fast and loudly for unexpected errors. For expected failures (e.g., invalid user input), provide clear feedback.
- **Structured Logging**: Log errors with a consistent structure (e.g., JSON) including a timestamp, error level, message, and relevant context (like a trace ID).
- **Log Levels**: Use appropriate log levels (e.g., `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`). Keep production logs clean by default (INFO and above).
- **No Sensitive Data in Logs**: Ensure logs do not contain sensitive user information like passwords, API keys, or personal data.

### Version Control
- Follow conventional commit standards for commit messages (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
- Create feature branches from the main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
- Keep pull requests small and focused on a single issue.
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting a review or merging.

### Dependency Management
- Before adding a new dependency, verify it is well-maintained, secure, and aligns with the project's license.
- Use a lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure deterministic installs.
- Avoid adding dependencies for trivial tasks that can be solved with a few lines of code.
- Regularly review and update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

### Code Documentation
- Comment on the *why*, not the *what*. Assume the reader understands the language, but not the business logic or design decisions.
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions, especially public APIs, to clarify their purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes. Delete stale or misleading comments.
- Avoid commented-out code. If it's not used, remove it. Version control has the history.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Scope Creep
- No feature suggestions unless explicitly requested
- No "improvements" or "fixes" beyond the requested scope
- No accessibility features unless asked
- No performance optimizations unless requested
- No code reorganization unless asked

### Code Quality Issues
- No hardcoded values where variables should be used
- No console.log in production code
- No unused imports or variables
- No overly complex functions or components
- No mixed concerns in single files

### Communication Issues
- No unnecessary explanations or commentary
- No assumptions about user requirements
- No corporate fluff or overly polite language
- No suggestions for "better" approaches unless asked
- No feature additions "for completeness"

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Parallel Execution
- Default to parallel tool calls unless operations must be sequential
- Execute multiple searches, file reads, or information gathering simultaneously
- Plan searches upfront and execute together rather than waiting for each result
- Sequential calls only when output of A is required for input of B

### File Operations
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Use `edit_file` for all file modifications. Be precise with edits in large files to ensure accuracy.
- Always clean up temporary files created during iteration
- Follow project's file naming conventions exactly

### Code Generation
- Never output code to user unless requested - use code edit tools instead
- Add all necessary imports, dependencies, and endpoints
- Ensure generated code integrates with existing build configuration
- Fix clear linting errors immediately, but don't loop more than 3 times

**Remember**: Be raw, be helpful, drop code like it's hot. Stay technically accurate. No bullshit, just results.
